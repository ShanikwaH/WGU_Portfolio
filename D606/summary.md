# Course Summary
**D606: Data Science Capstone** 

D606 is the capstone course for the Data Science program, requiring students to propose, implement, and present a comprehensive data analytics project. It integrates knowledge from various data science specialization courses to address a real-world research question, culminating in a detailed analysis report and a presentation of findings.
# Course Objectives 
WGU outlines the following competencies as a part of this class:
- **Proposes a Data Analytics Approach:** The learner proposes a data analytics approach to address a business problem.
- **Implements a Data Analytics Approach:** The learner implements a data analytics approach to address a business problem.
- **Communicates Information and Data Trends:** The learner communicates information and data trends using data storytelling and visualization.
# Course Materials 
This course requires the submission of a "Data Science Capstone Topic Approval Form" and a "Data Science Capstone Release Form". Students can choose from provided datasets or create their own. Panopto video recordings are required for Task 3.
Practical Assessment(s) Overview & Files
- **Task 1:** Proposing a Data Analytics Approach
    - **Description:** Learners must identify a real-data research question and propose a project utilizing analysis techniques from data science specialization courses (machine learning, artificial intelligence, optimization). This requires completing and submitting a signed "Data Science Capstone Topic Approval Form" that describes how the project proposal employs learned approaches. Additionally, a digitally signed "Data Science Capstone Release Form" must be submitted.
    - **Output Files:** "Data Science Capstone Topic Approval Form" and "Data Science Capstone Release Form".
- **Task 2:** Data Analysis Report
    - **Description:** This task involves creating a report based on the research question identified in Task 1. The report must summarize the research question, including its justification, context, and a discussion of the hypothesis. It details the data collection process, describing relevant data collected, one advantage and one disadvantage of the data-gathering methodology, and challenges overcome. The data extraction and preparation process is described, including screenshots, tools/techniques used, and one advantage and one disadvantage of the methods. The data analysis report includes a description of the technique(s) used, calculations, outputs, and justification of the analysis technique(s) (with one advantage and one disadvantage). Finally, the implications of the data analysis are summarized, including results in the context of the research question, one limitation, a recommended course of action, and two directions or approaches for future study of the dataset.
    - **Output Files:** A data analysis report (document file).
- **Task 3:** Presenting the Data Analysis Findings
    - **Description:** This task requires presenting findings from Task 2 using Panopto to a nontechnical audience. The presentation must feature the presenter visibly, simultaneously capturing both the presenter and the multimedia presentation. The presentation content should include:
        - **A brief introduction of the presenter and background.**
        - **A statement of the problem and hypothesis.**
        - **A summary of the data analysis process.**
        - **An outline of the findings.**
        - **An explanation of the limitations of the techniques and tools used.**
        - **A summary of proposed actions.**
        - **Expected benefits of the study (specific and quantitative as possible).**
    - **Output Files:** A Panopto video recording of the presentation.
