    "## C. Time Series Model Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding and validating the assumptions underlying time series models is critical for reliable analysis and accurate forecasting. This section provides a comprehensive summary of key assumptions that guide ARIMA modeling and their implications for medical revenue analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Stationarity Assumption**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition and Importance:**\n",
    "Stationarity is the fundamental assumption that the statistical properties of a time series remain constant over time. A stationary time series exhibits:\n",
    "- **Constant Mean**: E[Xt] = μ for all time periods t\n",
    "- **Constant Variance**: Var[Xt] = σ² for all time periods t  \n",
    "- **Time-Invariant Covariance**: Cov[Xt, Xt+k] depends only on lag k, not on time t\n",
    "\n",
    "**Medical Revenue Context:**\n",
    "- Revenue growth trends violate stationarity assumptions\n",
    "- Seasonal variations in patient volume create non-constant variance\n",
    "- Economic cycles and policy changes affect long-term revenue patterns\n",
    "- **Solution**: First-differencing transforms non-stationary revenue to stationary changes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Testing and Validation:**\n",
    "- Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test for unit root detection\n",
    "- KPSS test for stationarity confirmation\n",
    "- Visual inspection of time plots and rolling statistics\n",
    "- Post-transformation re-testing to confirm stationarity achievement\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Autocorrelated Data Assumption**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition and Significance:**\n",
    "Autocorrelation assumes that current observations are correlated with past values in a predictable pattern. This temporal dependence is the foundation for time series forecasting:\n",
    "- **Serial Correlation**: Xt is correlated with Xt-1, Xt-2, ..., Xt-k\n",
    "- **Memory Effect**: Past revenue levels influence future performance\n",
    "- **Lag Structure**: Different time lags may exhibit varying correlation strengths\n",
    "\n",
    "**Healthcare Revenue Applications:**\n",
    "- **Patient Flow Continuity**: Today's patient volume affects tomorrow's revenue\n",
    "- **Treatment Cycles**: Multi-day treatments create revenue dependencies\n",
    "- **Referral Patterns**: Patient referrals generate correlated revenue streams\n",
    "- **Appointment Scheduling**: Booking patterns create short-term correlations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Measurement and Modeling:**\n",
    "- Autocorrelation Function (ACF) quantifies correlations at different lags\n",
    "- Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) isolates direct correlations\n",
    "- ARIMA parameters (p,d,q) model specific autocorrelation structures\n",
    "- Ljung-Box test validates residual independence\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Additional Critical Assumptions**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3.1 Linearity Assumption**\n",
    "- **Requirement**: Relationships between variables are approximately linear\n",
    "- **Medical Context**: Revenue responses to external factors should be proportional\n",
    "- **Implications**: Non-linear transformations may be needed for complex relationships\n",
    "- **Validation**: Residual analysis and linearity diagnostic plots\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3.2 Normality of Residuals**\n",
    "- **Requirement**: Model errors follow a normal distribution\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Enables reliable confidence interval construction\n",
    "- **Testing**: Shapiro-Wilk test, Q-Q plots, histogram analysis\n",
    "- **Impact**: Non-normality affects forecast interval accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3.3 Homoscedasticity (Constant Variance)**\n",
    "- **Requirement**: Error variance remains constant over time\n",
    "- **Healthcare Relevance**: Revenue volatility should be consistent across periods\n",
    "- **Detection**: Residual plots, Breusch-Pagan test\n",
    "- **Solutions**: Variance stabilizing transformations if needed\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3.4 Independence of Residuals**\n",
    "- **Requirement**: Model errors are uncorrelated after accounting for temporal structure\n",
    "- **Validation**: ACF of residuals should show no significant correlations\n",
    "- **Importance**: Confirms model adequately captures data patterns\n",
    "- **Testing**: Ljung-Box test on residual autocorrelations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3.5 No Missing Values**\n",
    "- **Requirement**: Complete time series without gaps\n",
    "- **Medical Context**: Continuous daily revenue recording\n",
    "- **Handling**: Imputation strategies or explicit gap modeling if needed\n",
    "- **Verification**: Data completeness assessment and gap identification\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Model Selection Implications**\n",
    "\n",
    "**ARIMA Parameter Interpretation:**\n",
    "- **p (AutoRegressive)**: Number of lagged revenue values influencing current revenue\n",
    "- **d (Integrated)**: Degree of differencing required to achieve stationarity\n",
    "- **q (Moving Average)**: Number of lagged forecast errors incorporated in predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assumption Violations and Remedies:**\n",
    "- **Non-stationarity**: Apply differencing or detrending transformations\n",
    "- **Heteroscedasticity**: Consider GARCH modeling for variance structure\n",
    "- **Non-linearity**: Explore threshold or regime-switching models\n",
    "- **Seasonality**: Incorporate seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) components\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Business Context and Practical Considerations**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Healthcare Industry Factors:**\n",
    "- **Regulatory Changes**: Policy shifts may alter underlying data structure\n",
    "- **Seasonal Patterns**: Patient behavior varies with holidays, weather, epidemics\n",
    "- **Economic Cycles**: Broader economic conditions affect healthcare utilization\n",
    "- **Technological Advances**: New treatments or systems may create structural breaks\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Robustness:**\n",
    "- Regular assumption testing throughout model lifecycle\n",
    "- Sensitivity analysis for parameter stability\n",
    "- Out-of-sample validation for assumption verification\n",
    "- Periodic model re-estimation as new data becomes available\n",
