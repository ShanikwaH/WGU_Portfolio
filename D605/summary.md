# Course Summary
**D605: Optimization** 

D605 focuses on identifying, mathematically representing, and solving optimization problems in business scenarios. It guides learners through analyzing business needs, defining objective functions and constraints, and implementing computational solutions using programming languages.
# Course Objectives 
WGU outlines the following competencies as a part of this class:
- **Analyzes a Business Case:** The learner analyzes a business case to recommend a particular optimization approach.
- **Identifies the Objective Function and Constraints:** The learner identifies the objective function and constraints for an optimization problem.
- **Solves an Optimization Problem:** The learner solves an optimization problem programmatically.
Course Materials This course primarily uses Python or R for programming solutions in Task 3. Supporting documents for scenarios are provided, such as "Amazon Air Optimization Solution" and "Amazon Distribution" for Task 2. Code is submitted through a cloud repository platform.
# Practical Assessment(s) Overview & Files
- **Task 1:** Business Case Analysis
    - **Description:** The task is to identify a business need that could benefit from an optimization approach. Learners must explain why the identified business need can be addressed using an optimization approach, identify the linearity of the optimization problem, and identify the type of optimization problem found. They also need to identify the optimization objective, decision variables, and two or more constraints that are components of the optimization approach. Any endpoint considerations in the optimization approach must be explained. Finally, learners recommend an optimization method appropriate for the problem identified.
    - **Output Files:** A document file containing the business case analysis.
- **Task 2:** Solve an Optimization Problem
    - **Description:** This task requires identifying an optimization problem within a given scenario (e.g., using "Amazon Air Optimization Solution" and "Amazon Distribution" documents). Learners must create mathematical representations of the components of the optimization problem by writing an expression for the objective function, expressions for the constraints, and identifying the decision variables. The approach to solve the optimization is described, including the optimization method/algorithm and the tools/technologies used. The risks and limitations involved in the recommended optimization approach are assessed.
    - **Output Files:** A document file detailing the identified problem, mathematical representations, approach, and risks.
- **Task 3:** Identification of the Objective Function and Constraints
    - **Description:** This task involves providing a computational solution for the problem defined in Task 2, implemented in either Python or R. Learners must demonstrate that the solver provided a solution to the optimization problem. The output of the model is analyzed to demonstrate that all constraints are satisfied, that the solution includes decision variables, constraints, and the objective function, and an explanation of why the solution matches the expected output is provided. A reflection on how the development of the candidate's approach matched the expectations of the process is also required.
    - **Output Files:** A program file (Python or R code) and a document file with the analysis of the output and reflection. Code must be submitted through a cloud repository platform.
