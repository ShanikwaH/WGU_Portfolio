# Course Summary
**D604: Advanced Analytics** 

D604 explores advanced analytical techniques, specifically Neural Networks and Natural Language Processing (NLP). It tasks learners with building and testing complex models for various data types (image, audio, video, text) and presenting their findings in detailed reports and interactive environments.
# Course Objectives 
WGU outlines the following competencies as a part of this class:
- **Applies Neural Networks:** The learner applies neural networks to solve a business problem.
- **Applies Natural Language Processing:** The learner applies natural language processing to solve a business problem.
# Course Materials
This course uses the WGU virtual lab environment (Cloud Academy). Reports are generated using an industry-relevant interactive development environment (e.g., R Markdown document, Jupyter Notebook), with PDF or HTML output. TensorFlow or PyTorch are mentioned for neural network models in Task 2.
# Practical Assessment(s) Overview & Files
- **Task 1:** Neural Networks
    - **Description:** The task is to build a neural network designed to learn from image, audio, or video data using computer vision techniques. Learners select one of these scenarios and define a research question and objectives/goals, identify an industry-relevant neural network type, and justify its choice. Data preparation steps are detailed for the chosen scenario:
        - **Image Scenario:** Exploratory data analysis (visualization, sample images), data augmentation/justification, normalization steps, train-validation-test split justification, target encoding, and a copy of prepared datasets.
        - **Video Scenario:** Train-validation-test split, splitting video into frames, removing noisy frames, formatting frames, extracting features, considering video frame sequence, copy of prepared datasets, and justification of data preparation steps.
        - **Audio Scenario:** Exploratory data analysis (spectrogram, audio tagging), audio signal creation, signal padding, spectrogram normalization, feature extraction for sound classification, data preparation steps, train-validation-test split, copy of prepared datasets, and justification of data preparation steps.
    - **Network architecture is described, including a model summary output, components (number of layers, types of layers, nodes per layer, total parameters, activation functions), and the backpropagation process (loss function, optimizer, learning rate, stopping criteria). A screenshot of the confusion matrix is required. Model evaluation involves assessing the training process, impact of stopping criteria (screenshot), comparing training to validation data (loss, accuracy, F1, MAE), visualizing training vs. validation loss (screenshot), assessing model fitness (overfitting/underfitting), and discussing predictive accuracy. The report concludes with a summary and recommendations, including lessons learned and a course of action.**
      - **Output Files:** A report generated in an interactive development environment (e.g., R Markdown, Jupyter Notebook), including PDF or HTML output, and a list of web sources for third-party code.
- **Task 2:** Sentiment Analysis Using Neural Networks
    - **Description:** The goal is to build a neural network for word usage and context using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to perform sentiment analysis on the "UCI Sentiment Labeled Sentences Dataset". This includes summarizing a research question (neural network and NLP), defining objectives/goals, and identifying an industry-relevant neural network type for text classification. Data preparation involves exploratory data analysis (unusual characters, vocabulary size, word embedding length, statistical justification for max sequence length), describing the tokenization process (code and packages for text normalization), explaining the padding process (standardize length, when padding occurs, screenshot of padded sequence), identifying categories of sentiment and activation function, explaining data preparation steps (training/validation/test split based on industry average), and providing a copy of the prepared dataset. Network architecture involves describing the type of neural network (TensorFlow or PyTorch), providing the model summary output, and justifying the choice of hyperparameters (activation functions, nodes per layer, loss function, optimizer, stopping criteria). Model evaluation includes discussing the impact of stopping criteria (screenshot of final training epoch), assessing model fitness, providing visualizations of the training process (line graph of loss/evaluation metric), discussing predictive accuracy, and explaining compliance with AI global ethical standards. The report provides recommendations based on results.
  - **Output Files:** A report generated in an interactive development environment (e.g., R Markdown, Jupyter Notebook), including PDF or HTML output, code to save the trained network, and a list of web sources for third-party code.
