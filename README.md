This portfolio documents my work in the Master of Science in Data Analytics – Data Science Specialization (MSDA-DS) program at Western Governors University, completed August 2025. It represents a deliberate shift from public-facing service roles into the technical space of data analytics, blending operational insight with statistical rigor to generate business value. I created this portfolio as both a record of competence for employers and a resource for others in the MSDA program. Throughout my education and career, I’ve worked in mission-driven environments where observation, documentation, and process fidelity were critical. This body of work reflects that same discipline applied to analytics: translating noise into clarity, patterns into strategy, and processes into measurable improvement. I completed my education to make a career change into data science, and this portfolio showcases that work for prospective employers, while also providing useful resources for other students following behind me in this program. I benefited tremendously from the tips and advice of prior students throughout my educational journey, and this is a part of my ongoing pledge to return the favor and ensure more people get up the ladder that I've finished climbing. 

# Classes, Projects, Presentations, and Reviews
Each row in the table below links to individual deliverables from the MSDA program. "Class Summary" entries describe the course, its major tasks, and how I approached them. “Class Writeups” link to personal reflections and peer guidance I shared on the WGU_MSDA subreddit, capturing practical takeaways, technical strategies, and real-world application notes. Employers should prioritize the summaries and videos for quick evaluation of my applied skillset. The table below contains all of the work performed for my MSDA (graduated Aug 2025). Employers will find the most use from clicking on the "Class Summary" links to get descriptions of a class, its requisite projects, and summaries of how I completed them, including links to those materials. Students will find the most use from clicking on the "Class Writeup" links to read my posts from the [WGU_MSDA](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU_MSDA/) subreddit, where I covered my experiences with each class, including stumbling blocks, useful resources, etc. Links directly to reports, video presentations, etc., are also directly available in the table.

This program was completed over 6 months while balancing prior responsibilities in public safety, juvenile education, and logistics. My approach was shaped by years of frontline work—collecting raw data, identifying anomalies, and making sense of human-centered systems. That mindset transferred directly into this work: making meaning out of messy inputs, building repeatable systems, and documenting each step to ensure transparency. The above works represent the cumulative effort spent over 6 months to go from some college credits or programming experience to having a master's degree in the field of data science. While I'm aware that I have limited professional experience, it is my hope that the effort demonstrated in this process emphasizes that I am deeply motivated to continue to learn in this field and to make the most of any opportunity given to me. Any hiring represents some amount of risk or uncertainty, but I believe that this drive to learn and succeed combined with my soft skills and life experiences from a career in public service and my perspective as a "young adult" make me an excellent candidate to take that chance on, so that I can grow with an organization and we can enjoy a long and fruitful partnership. I don’t claim deep tenure in the data field, but this portfolio shows I understand how to generate insights, present them clearly, and support operational improvement with evidence. I aim to grow within an analytics function that values communication, integrity, and impact.

My core strengths lie in Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn), R (tidyverse), and SQL, with project-level exposure to Tableau and Power BI. I've built regression models, interactive dashboards, exploratory visualizations, and segmentation frameworks. My interest extends beyond analytics roles—I am open to opportunities in business intelligence, operations analysis, compliance, or data management, wherever pattern recognition and insight delivery are mission-critical. While the majority of my work above (and in my other portfolios) involves Python programming and data analysis in particular, something I would like to emphasize to prospective employers is that I am flexible in what I am looking for. While the bulk of my experience is in Python and analysis, I do have some experience with SQL and data management. I am open to and see benefits in working in data management or other fields within data science, as I understand that I would be well served by expanding the scope of my knowledge and experience within the field.

# Acknowledgements
I earned this degree as a career reset, supported by family who believed in my potential long before any of this work existed. They absorbed the real costs—time, attention, and resources—while I studied. Every skill here was sharpened because they held the line when I couldn’t. As always, the biggest thanks go out to my family and friends. I went back to school in 2025, uncertain if I was too young to learn my way around the tech industry or to learn something like Python programming. My family and friends picked up the slack to make sure that we could afford for me to pursue my education and make a career change, and they were also my biggest cheerleaders throughout the whole process. My family and friends were even willing to be students, letting me teach some Python back to them early on so that I could really learn some of these concepts. None of this would've been possible without them. My success is entirely a credit to them.

Special thanks to the [r/WGU_MSDA/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU_MSDA/) community. I relied on the scattered but essential documentation shared by prior students and added my own experiences back into the loop. That cycle of clarity, feedback, and knowledge transfer shaped how I approached not just coursework, but the professional standards I now bring to analytics. Another huge debt of gratitude goes out to the community at [r/WGU_MSDA/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU_MSDA/) and everyone who participates there in sharing their experiences, mistakes, and resources throughout the program. It was a pretty inactive subreddit since the curriculum had changed only a year before I started, but some people went through the program ahead of me and started posting their experiences in each class. Those were super helpful to me, and so I started posting my own experiences there as well. I've enjoyed helping others coming through the program after me, and I hope it carries on.

For the markdown table above, I used Table Generator for efficiency. It allows clean visual formatting without manual markdown coding—another small way of reducing friction and increasing clarity in documentation workflows. Like my prior portfolios, the Table Generator was a super useful tool to allow me to build the nice-looking table up above in a GUI to then be copied and pasted into this document as markdown. There's no reason to make a markdown table yourself when you could do it much more easily with the Table Generator.
