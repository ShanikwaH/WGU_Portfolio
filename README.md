This is a portfolio of my work in the Master of Science in Data Analytics - Data Science Specialization (MSDA-DS) degree program at Western Governors University. I completed my education to make a career change into data science, and this portfolio showcases that work for prospective employers, while also providing useful resources for other students following behind me in this program. I benefited tremendously from the tips and advice of prior students throughout my educational journey, and this is a part of my ongoing issue to return the favor and ensure more people get up the ladder that I've finished climbing.

Classes, Projects, Presentations, and Reviews
The table below contains all of the work performed for my MSDA (graduated Aug 2025). Employers will find the most use from clicking on the "Class Summary" links to get descriptions of a class, its requisite projects, and summaries of how I completed them, including links to those materials. Students will find the most use from clicking on the "Class Writeup" links to read my posts from the WGU_MSDA subreddit, where I covered my experiences with each class, including stumbling blocks, useful resources, etc. Links directly to reports, video presentations, etc., are also directly available in the table.

| Class Summary  | Task/Project Name  | Project Video  | Class Writeup  | Time Spent (hh:mm) | Date Completed  |
|D596            |---|---|---|---|---|
|D597            |   |   |   |   |   |
|D598            |   |   |   |   |   |
|D599            |   |   |   |   |   |
|D600            |   |   |   |   |   |
|D601            |   |   |   |   |   |
|D602            |   |   |   |   |   |
|D603            |   |   |   |   |   |
|D604            |   |   |   |   |   |

The above works represent the cumulative effort spent over 6 months to go from some college credits or programming experience to having a master's degree in the field of data science. While I'm aware that I have limited professional experience, it is my hope that the effort demonstrated in this process emphasizes that I am deeply motivated to continue to learn in this field and to make the most of any opportunity given to me. Any hiring represents some amount of risk or uncertainty, but I believe that this drive to learn and succeed combined with my soft skills and life experiences from a career in public service and my perspective as an "elder milennial" make me an excellent candidate to take that chance on, so that I can grow with an organization and we can enjoy a long and fruitful partnership.

While the majority of my work above (and in my other portfolios) involves Python programming and data analysis in particular, something I would like to emphasize to prospective employers is that I am flexible in what I am looking for. While the bulk of my experience is in Python and analysis, I do have some experience with SQL and data management. I am open to and see benefits in working in data management or other fields within data science, as I understand that I would be well served by expanding the scope of my knowledge and experience within the field.

Acknowledgements
As always, the biggest thanks go out to my family and friends. I went back to school in 2025, uncertain if I was too old to learn my way around the tech industry or to learn something like Python programming. My family and friends picked up the slack to make sure that we could afford for me to pursue my education and make a career change, and they were also my biggest cheerleaders throughout the whole process. My family and friends were even willing to be students, letting me teach some Python back to them early on so that I could really learn some of these concepts. None of this would've been possible without them. My success is entirely a credit to them.

Another huge debt of gratitude goes out to the community at r/WGU_MSDA/ and everyone who participates there in sharing their experiences, mistakes, and resources throughout the program. It was a pretty inactive subreddit since the curriculum had changed only a year before I started, but some people went through the program ahead of me and started posting their experiences in each class. Those were super helpful to me, and so I started posting my own experiences there as well. I've enjoyed helping others coming through the program after me, and I hope it carries on.

Like my prior portfolios, the Table Generator was a super useful tool to allow me to build the nice-looking table up above in a GUI to then be copied and pasted into this document as markdown. There's no reason to make a markdown table yourself when you could do it much more easily with the Table Generator.
