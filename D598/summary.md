# Course Summary
- **D598: Analytics Programming** 
D598 focuses on developing programming skills for data analysis, transitioning from pseudocode to functional programs and creating data visualizations for stakeholders. It emphasizes integrating programming language syntax, control elements, and modular components to perform data acquisition and organization tasks.
# Course Objectives 
WGU outlines the following competencies as a part of this class:
- **Integrates Syntax, Control Elements, and Modular Components:** The learner integrates programming language syntax, control elements, and modular components from common data analytics programming languages to create simple programs.
- **Performs Data Acquisition and Organization Tasks:** The learner performs data acquisition and organization tasks using a data analytics programming language.
# Course Materials 
This course primarily uses Python or R for coding solutions. Code is managed using a GitLab repository.
# Practical Assessment(s) Overview & Files
- **Task 1:** Flowchart and Pseudocode
    - **Description:** This task requires creating a flowchart and pseudocode appropriate for a given task and explaining the logic behind them. It also includes explaining the alignment between the flowchart and the pseudocode.
- **Output Files:** Document file containing the flowchart, pseudocode, and explanations.
- **Task 2:** Coding
    - **Description:** Learners are hired by an investment company to analyze performance data. They must write programs in Python or R to:
        - **Import a data file into a data frame.**
        - **Identify any duplicate rows.**
        - **Group IDs by state, run descriptive statistics (mean, median, min, max) for numeric variables by state, and store results in a new data frame.**
        - **Filter the data frame to identify businesses with negative debt-to-equity ratios.**
        - **Create a new data frame with debt-to-income ratio (long-term debt divided by revenue) for every business.**
        - **Concatenate the new debt-to-income ratio data frame with the original data frame.**
    - **Output Files:** The Python or R program must be provided and stored in a GitLab repository.
- **Task 3:** Presentation
    - **Description:** This task requires creating a report for stakeholders of the investment company scenario from Task 1. The report must:
        - **Explain how the code from Task 2 works.**
        - **Provide four customized data visualizations.**
        - **Explain how these customized visualizations were created.**
    - **Output Files:** A document file containing the explanation of code, customized data visualizations, and explanations of their creation.
