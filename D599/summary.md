# Course Summary
**D599: Data Preparation and Exploration** 

D599 focuses on preparing and exploring data according to business and data analytic needs, interpreting statistics and visualizations, and wrangling data to ensure accuracy, format, and integrity. It covers a range of techniques from data cleaning and profiling to statistical analysis and market basket analysis.
# Course Objectives 
WGU outlines the following competencies as a part of this class:
- **Profiles Data:** The learner interprets a data dictionary to understand the data set.
- **Interprets Statistics and Visualization:** The learner interprets probability, descriptive and inferential statistics, and visualization.
- **Wrangling Data:** The learner wrangles data to ensure accuracy, format, and integrity relevant to the task being performed.
# Course Materials 
This course uses Anaconda or RStudio as the integrated development environment (IDE). Datasets like "Employee Turnover Dataset," "Health Insurance Dataset," and "Megastore Dataset" are provided. Panopto video recordings are a submission requirement for all tasks.
# Practical Assessment(s) Overview & Files
- **Task 1:** Data Cleaning and Profiling
    - **Description:** Act as a data analyst for a multinational technology firm dealing with employee turnover. The goal is to profile and clean a raw dataset to optimize it for future analysis and model building. This involves reviewing a data dictionary to describe dataset characteristics (rows, columns, data types, subtypes, observable values). The dataset must be inspected for quality issues such as duplicate entries, missing values, inconsistent entries, formatting errors, and outliers, with findings listed. Learners then discuss and describe the data cleaning techniques used to correct these issues, including advantages and limitations of their approach.
  - **Output Files:** A data cleaning report (document file), annotated code (executable script), a cleaned dataset (CSV file), and a Panopto video recording demonstrating code functionality and discussing the programming environment.
- **Task 2:** Data Exploration
    - **Description:** Analyze a large health insurance company's data to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations. This task requires identifying and visually representing the distribution of two continuous and two categorical variables using univariate and bivariate statistics. Learners must describe a real-world organizational issue, propose a research question, and identify relevant variables. They then identify a parametric statistical test, develop null and alternative hypotheses, write code to run the test, and provide output/results. The results are evaluated by justifying the test choice, discussing the decision to reject/fail to reject the null hypothesis, and explaining stakeholder benefits. A similar process is followed for a nonparametric statistical test. Finally, implications are summarized, including answering the research question, discussing limitations, and recommending a course of action.
  - **Output Files:** A document file containing the statistical analysis, visualizations, and explanations, along with the code for each statistical test. A Panopto video recording demonstrating code functionality and commenting on the programming environment is also required.
- **Task 3:** Market Basket Analysis
    - **Description:** Act as a data analyst for Allias Megastore to understand customer characteristics and purchase patterns. The task involves proposing a research question and defining a goal for market basket analysis. Learners explain how the market basket technique analyzes the dataset, including expected outcomes, provide a transaction example, and summarize an assumption of the analysis. Data preparation includes wrangling categorical variables (at least two ordinal, two nominal), performing appropriate encoding methods (ordinal, label, one-hot), and transactionalizing the data for market basket analysis, with explanations and justifications for each step. Code for generating association rules with the Apriori algorithm must be executed and a screenshot of error-free code provided. Values for support, lift, and confidence of the association rules table are required (with screenshot), along with an explanation of the top three relevant rules. The analysis is summarized by discussing the significance of support, lift, and confidence, explaining practical significance of findings, and recommending a course of action.
  - **Output Files:** A document file with the report details, a copy of the cleaned dataset, screenshots of code execution and results, and a Panopto video recording demonstrating code functionality and summarizing tools.
