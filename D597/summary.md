# Course Summary
- **D597: Data Management** 

D597 focuses on the design and implementation of database solutions, including both relational and non-relational databases. It requires learners to explore, design, implement, and present database solutions using real-world datasets.
# Course Objectives 
WGU outlines the following competencies as a part of this class:
- **Recommends an Appropriate Data Architecture:** The learner recommends an appropriate data architecture.
- **Examines the Data Available for Analysis:** The learner examines the data available for analysis to determine their dimension, quality, relations, and limitations.
- **Constructs a Logical Data Model:** The learner constructs a logical data model.
- **Implements Physical Data Models:** The learner implements physical data models by incorporating required data.
- **Performs Queries to Answer a Business Question:** The learner performs database queries to answer a business question.
- **Uses Appropriate Data Manipulation Language Statements:** The learner uses appropriate data manipulation language statements to manage data.
# Course Materials 
This course primarily uses the WGU Virtual Lab environment for database implementation. Task 1 involves CSV files for relational databases, while Task 2 uses JSON files for non-relational databases, specifically mentioning MongoDB. Panopto video recordings are required for presentations.
# Practical Assessment(s) Overview & Files
- **Task 1:** Relational Database Design and Implementation
    - **Description:** Learners select a scenario and describe a business problem solvable with a database, propose a data structure, justify the database solution, and explain data usage. They then create a logical data model, describe database objects and storage (identifying file attributes), discuss scalability concerns and strategies, and outline privacy/security measures. Implementation involves writing scripts to create a database instance named "D597 Task 1" based on the logical model, import data from chosen CSV files, and write three queries to solve the business problem. Optimization techniques must be applied to improve query run time. A Panopto video recording is required, featuring a visible presenter demonstrating the functional database solution in the lab environment, discussing database design/indexing for performance, technical environment, and query functionality/problem-solving.
  - **Output Files:** Design document (Part 1), screenshots of executed scripts and output (Part 2), and a Panopto video recording (Part 3).
- **Task 2:** Non-Relational Database Design and Implementation
    - **Description:** Learners select a scenario (preferably different from Task 1) and describe a business problem solvable with a database, justify a NoSQL database solution, identify an appropriate NoSQL database type, and explain data usage. They also discuss scalability concerns and strategies, and outline privacy/security measures for the proposed design. Implementation involves writing scripts to create a database instance named "D597 Task 2", insert/map data from chosen JSON files, write three queries, and apply optimization techniques for improved run time. A Panopto video recording is required, demonstrating the functional database solution, discussing database design/indexing for performance, technical environment, and script functionality/problem-solving.
  - **Output Files:** Design document (Part 1), screenshots of executed scripts and output (Part 2), and a Panopto video recording (Part 3).
