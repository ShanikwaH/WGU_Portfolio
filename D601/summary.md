# Course Summary
**D601: Data Storytelling for Varied Audiences** 

D601 emphasizes the crucial skill of representing and reporting data insights to diverse stakeholders, both technical and non-technical. It involves creating interactive dashboards using Tableau and effectively communicating data through presentations tailored to different audiences.
# Course Objectives 
WGU outlines the following competencies as a part of this class:
- **Conducts an Audience Analysis:** The learner conducts an audience analysis.
- **Communicates Data Insights:** The learner communicates data insights to technical and nontechnical audiences.
- **Creates Data Representations:** The learner creates data representations to offer insights into an organizational problem.
- **Designs Interactive Dashboards:** The learner designs interactive dashboards to support executive decision-making.
- **Demonstrates How Interpersonal Skills Are Applied in Communication:** The learner demonstrates how interpersonal skills are applied to effectively communicate.
# Course Materials 
This course primarily uses Tableau for creating interactive dashboards. Datasets provided include "Telecommunications Churn Data" or "Medical Readmission Data". Panopto video recordings are a core submission requirement for Task 2.
# Practical Assessment(s) Overview & Files
- **Task 1:** Building an Interactive Dashboard
    - **Description:** As a data analyst, the task is to build an interactive Tableau dashboard for non-technical executive leaders to guide decision-making. The dashboard must be submitted in a .twbx format and include four different data representations summarizing data or displaying trends aligned with the chosen scenario (Telecommunications Churn or Medical Readmission). It also requires two filters that allow users to modify data representation, two metrics or Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), and must be accessible to users with colorblindness. A written paper is required to:
        - **Provide step-by-step instructions for a non-technical executive leader to open and navigate the dashboard using both filters.**
        - **Explain how the dashboard's purpose aligns with the chosen scenario's needs.**
        - **Explain three different ways to change the data storytelling approach when presenting to technical versus nontechnical audiences.**
        - **Identify two elements of effective storytelling and explain how each would engage the audience.**
    - **Output Files:** A Tableau dashboard (.twbx file) and a written paper (document file).
- **Task 2:** Dashboard Presentation
    - **Description:** Using the dashboard created in Task 1, learners must create a Panopto video presentation for a technical audience of data analytics peers. The video must include a screen share of the presenter and their multimedia presentation. The presentation should:
        - **Include two elements of effective storytelling.**
        - **Introduce the presenter, their background, and describe the dataset and scenario used.**
        - **Present two data representations from the dashboard, explaining their relevance and choice justification.**
        - **Demonstrate two filters and explain how they improve usability and data exploration.**
        - **Explain how the dashboard was designed for colorblind accessibility and discuss two additional design choices for accessibility.**
        - **Reflect on the presentation by explaining the implementation of the two storytelling elements and discussing one lesson learned from creating the dashboard and one lesson learned from creating the presentation, including future applications.**
    - **Output Files:** A Panopto video recording of the presentation.
